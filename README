Installation
----------------------------------------------------

To install the system you should have Python 2.5 or better.  Uncompress
the Xerblin-*.tar.gz file and cd to the directory it creates.  Run the
following as root (or using sudo):

    python setup.py install

And that should do it.  If you have any problems please email me (my
address is below.)  Include a copy of the complete traceback if any.

The setup command above will install the xerblin package into your python
site-packages directory and put the xerblin script itself somewhere on
your PATH.
