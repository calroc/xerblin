======================================================
Installation
----------------------------------------------------

To install the system you should have Python 2.5 or better.  Uncompress
the Xerblin-*.tar.gz file and cd to the directory it creates.  Run the
following as root (or using sudo):

    python setup.py install

And that should do it.  If you have any problems please email me (my
address is below.)  Include a copy of the complete traceback if any.

The setup command above will install the xerblin package into your python
site-packages directory and put the xerblin script itself somewhere on
your PATH.



======================================================
Running Xerblin
----------------------------------------------------

To use the system start xerblin in the background with a command like:

    xerblin &

There is a single commandline option:

    -s <script file>

        path to a Xerblin "script".  This script will be run on the
        Xerblin interpreter before the system is presented to the user.
        This is basically ".xerblinrc", however no file name is 
        automatically looked for or loaded.

There you go.  The system starts with the Guide open. If you want to 
know more please drop me a line,
