Introducing Xerblin...

How's this:

  * Don't show the CLI at all at first, in fact, don't make it the center of the app.
  * show a Text with the Guide in it,  mention the stack right away,  right click on some numbers,  add etc,   select and calc
  * Then mention commands Words , plugin words, dict, Inscribe, Expunge,

Guide should include words that bring up other docs.

Make words is a plugin module.  Have tut that presents it as normal way to build new words,  then mention making them manually with lookup and drag-n-drop
