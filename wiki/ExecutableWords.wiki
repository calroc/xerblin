#summary The basic unit of command.

An Executable Word can be considered a single unit of computer action. It encapsulates one action that your computer can perform. An Executable Word can be as low-level and simple as adding two integers together or as high-level as grep

Executable words differ from usual programs in several ways,

    * They carry additional Meta-Information about the action they perform:
          * A Name.
          * Descriptions of the input and output arguments of the word.
          * Help.
          * Manual information (either embedded or linked.)
          * Maybe an edit history or changelog, or "rollback" support data. 
    * They provide several "default" operations on the actions they encapsulate:
          * Execute it.
          * Open a document about it.
          * Allow it to be integrated into complex compound commands with other Executable Words. 
    * They take their input arguments from a given stack and return their output to it.
